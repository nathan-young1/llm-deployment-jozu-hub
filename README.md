# Blog Companion Repository

This repository accompanies the blog post **“Automate On-Prem LLM Deployment With Jozu Hub”** and contains a single Jupyter notebook (`main.ipynb`) that contains the comands and examples demonstrated in the article.

The goal of this repo is **reproducibility**: if you follow both the blog and notebook, you will install the required tooling, pull a Docker model, package it as a ModelKit using KitOps, and deploy it locally on Kubernetes using Minikube.
